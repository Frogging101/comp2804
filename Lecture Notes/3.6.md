#3.6.2 Newton's Binomial Theorum

Allows us to solve for coefficients in any polynomial.

Say we are trying to identify the coefficient at a x<sup>13</sup>y<sup>12</sup>...

We know that our value for `n` will be `25`, because of the sum of our exponents, `(n-k)+k`.

So the coefficient will be <sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub>, which evaluates to <code><sub>25</sub>C<sub>12</sub> = 5200300 </code>
